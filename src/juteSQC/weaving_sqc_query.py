"""Raw SQL builders for the Weaving Pick-SQC capture feature (jute SQC module).

One capture surface feeds the weaving planning grid:
  * jute_sqc_weaving_pick - multi-observation pick (picks-per-inch) readings per
    (date, loom, weaving quality); Act Picks is the AVG(picks) per
    (co_id, weaving_quality_id, entry_date), exposed via vw_weaving_pick_act and
    consumed downstream by last-date resolution. Each save is a NEW reading (no
    upsert); a reading is removed by soft-delete.

Mirrors spinning_sqc_query.py conventions: named binds, the ``:x IS NULL OR ...``
optional-filter idiom, and active = 1 soft-delete (active IS NULL legacy rows are
not expected on these freshly-created tables). The weaving-quality and loom lookups
are reused directly from weaving_query.py by the router
(get_weaving_entry_qualities_query / get_weaving_entry_machines_query) and are NOT
re-declared here.
